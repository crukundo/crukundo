### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on / only interested in working on open-source Bitcoin/Lightning projects. I am also a fellow with [BTrust Builders](https://builders.btrust.tech) currently helping educate the next generation of Bitcoin developers from Africa.

#### Current open-source projects

- **[EttaWallet](https://github.com/EttaWallet/EttaWallet)**: A simple open-source self-custodial lightning wallet with a strong bias towards usability, accessibility and pretty good UX.
  
- **[BitcoinUI RN](https://github.com/EttaWallet/etta-ui)**: An implementation of [Bitcoin Design](https://bitcoin.design)'s **[UI Kit](https://www.bitcoinuikit.com)** for React Native projects. 

- **[Paywalled](https://github.com/crukundo/lnd-paywall/)**: A blogging platform powered by the Lightning network so content creators can earn through Bitcoin micropayments.

- **[BTC Payment Processor](https://github.com/tobi-bams/BTC-Payment-Processor)**: A self-hosted bitcoin payment processor that allows businesses and individuals to invoice and accept Bitcoin payments. Features the BIP21 invoice with fallbacks for regular bitcoin addresses and BOLT11 lightning invoices.
