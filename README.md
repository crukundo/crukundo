### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Part of [Qala](https://qala.dev)'s genesis cohort. I am based in Kampala, Uganda and I am working full-time on open source Bitcoin projects. 


#### Projects

- **[EttaWallet](https://github.com/crukundo/EttaWallet)**: An open source Bitcoin/Lightning Wallet built on the contributions of the Bitcoin Design Community. 

- **[Paywalled](https://github.com/crukundo/lnd-paywall/)**: A blogging platform powered by the Lightning network so content creators can earn through Bitcoin micropayments.

- **[BTC Payment Processor](https://github.com/tobi-bams/BTC-Payment-Processor)**: A self-hosted bitcoin payment processor that allows businesses and individuals to invoice and accept Bitcoin payments. Features the BIP21 invoice with fallbacks for regular bitcoin addresses and BOLT11 lightning invoices.
